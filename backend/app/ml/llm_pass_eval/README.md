# LLM for Password Strength Evaluation

## Purpose

This code evaluates the strength of your passwords using a language model-based approach. It provides feedback indicating whether your passwords are strong or weak and includes an explanation to help you understand the assessment. While the evaluation may not always be perfectly accurate, the accompanying rationale offers valuable insights into potential weaknesses or strengths in your passwords. Use this feedback to identify patterns and improve your passwords' security with your MDP model as needed. 

## How To Use

1. Review the code carefully to identify all dependencies. Look for the import statements, as they list the libraries and modules the code relies on. Use these imports to determine which packages need to be installed in your Python environment to ensure the code runs smoothly.
2. Add your own API key for Google's Gemini into the second code box. Follow the instructions in the "Google Gemini API" section of this README.
3. Add your passwords in to the last code box to evaluate them. Do not change the number of passwords in the box from the original example.

## Google Gemini API

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Console - https://console.cloud.google.com/apis
2. Create a new project using the top navigation bar.
3. In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to APIs & Services > library and enable the Gemini API.
4. Go to APIs & Services > Credentials in the left-hand menu. Click Create Credentials and select API Key. Your new API key will appear in a dialog box. Do not add any application restrictions. Copy your API Key!
5. Put your API key into the section that says "YOUR OWN API KEY"
